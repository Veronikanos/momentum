Used technologies: HTML5, CSS3, vanila JavaScript, Webpack. No any libraries (except of fontawesome).
This project is my JS practice with a lot of skills such as element search methods, data output to the page; work with date and time; work with audio; saving data in local storage; using recursive setTimeout; division of js-code into modules; work with asynchronous requests.
There were implemented an app translation without libraries as well. Tried to get familiar with OOP (as init class for settings menu with further reusing).

âš™ Every 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 greeting and background image change automatically in case page is opened.
